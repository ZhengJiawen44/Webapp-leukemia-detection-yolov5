# KKP Blood Screening Project

## Description
The KKP Blood Screening Project is a web application designed for blood analysis using YOLOv5 object detection model deployed with Flask. This application allows users to upload an image and receive a labeled result indicating various blood cell types. The model is trained to detect 11 classes of blood cells, including:
- Lymphoblast: 752 instances
- Neutrophil: 263 instances
- Promyelocytes: 137 instances
- Dysplastic_Cell: 6 instances
- Lymphocytes: 4 instances
- Myelocytes: 4 instances
- Band_Neutrophils: 2 instances
- Nucleated_RBC: 2 instances
- Giant_Platelet: 1 instance
- Monocytes: 1 instance

For more detailed information about these cell types, refer to the `blood_detect` folder.
